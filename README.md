One-Stop Management System for Student Services

This repository contains the CS-2001 Data Structures assignment: a One-Stop Management System designed to streamline student service requests. Using arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues, this system manages requests, agents, and service logs effectively. The project demonstrates practical applications of linear data structures to solve real-world management challenges in an academic setting.

Project Highlights:

Request Handling: Queue-based system to manage and prioritize student service requests.
Agent Assignment: Linked list management for agent allocation and tracking.
Service History: Stack-based logging for easy review of past interactions.
This version highlights the key elements of the system while showcasing the data structures used in each feature.
